# All Plc Amp; Hmi Password Key Free Download
 
 
I have 4 devices enrolled in Apple Business Manager and Meraki DEP. I setup all 4 devices and profiles were pushed. The profiles installed however the managed Apple ID's I created could not install the free apps I had selected.
 
While trying to figure this issue out, I changed some settings. Now when factory reset or push a profile down to an IPad, I get asked by Remote Management for a Username and Password. I've determined this was in SM-Configuration- General-End User Authorization Settings and Owners. I've created usernames and passwords for the 3 staff which now pushes me through this stage. However, now the devices show up and unsupervised and I get told the Apple ID's can not download apps.

@Refyne if you are using DEP you shouldn't be asked to enter a users credentials for setup a device..... If the device was erased without clearing the activation lock you will need to enter in the Apple ID of the DEP account used with SM to proceed past the activation lock.
 
Thanks for the information! We are experiencing this problem too, but we can't find any credentials that work so we are getting stuck at that prompt. Also opened a case, 06717625. We have skids of new devices waiting to get setup by volunteers without any credentials. Did Meraki forget about DEP?
 
I have a similar issue, I have enrolled 8 devices out of the box with no issues, and when I enrol my next one I was prompted with a username and password. I am have checked all my settings and we don't use AD for user Authentication. Can any please help?
 
I tried this workaround early this afternoon (using a different username and password), and it still isn't recognizing that user. Admittedly, I created the user after I had initiated the erase/reenroll, but I would still think that should work.

BrianNelson, if you have a MacBook and haven't already tried it, I'd imagine if you forced a wipe from the Macbook and re-did the activation reach out it would hopefully notice that new account you created. But I don't think once you get to this Auth screen just going back to the Region settings will cause it to reach back out again.
 
But again, this is clearly a bug related to them deprecating the previous setting for being able to DISABLE auth entirely and it's not recognizing or caring if we have Authentication disabled or not.
 
"Thank you for that information Brian and we apologize for this inconvenience, this is part of a recent issue found and our development team is working on a fix for this, I have attached this to the parent case and will reach out to you with updates concerning this."
 
So, i've been away from this post for a few days doing trail and error and have learned a few things. From comments in this thread I see this is not an issue I created but a Meraki create error (now i don't feel as dumb...just dumb that i wasted 3-4 days of vacation trying to find what I done that created the issue).
 
So, I suspect this issue was created to solve another problem. Ensuring a user has company credentials, ensures that if a porch pirate robs a new iPad from a staff members porch, the pirate can not enter the device.....or thats what I think anyway.
 
I just reset the device and tried enroll again and didn't need login.
The dashboard still cannot select the 'deprecated' option and has 'Managed:Use Meraki hosted accounts' enabled, but does not require login.
Although the setting and behavior are not being the same, I think the code might have been changed at a level behind the Dashboard.
I'll keep an eye on the results of the opened case.
 
I can't tell everything about the case results, but I think this problem is completely solved.
We can understand that setting up enroll without logging in works when the Authenticatication (What is this typo? ) checkbox is empty as shown below.
 
I cannot find the email used for my account, or the password, OR the URL for the store itself. I signed up for a trial and forgot about it. I'm also not able to create a "support ticket" in the support database.

I have searched the help here, but can't find a solution ... my landlady got a new router with a new password. I can connect with hard wire but also need my wireless extender to work. From what I can tell after pushing the button in the back, it can see the new router, but needs the new password. How do I do that?
 
If your landlady's router supports WPS (there is a good chance that it does), then you can use it to connect your extender to her router without the password. You will want to follow the instructions on page 13 of the manual. Basically, push the WPS button on your extender and push the WPS button on her router within 2 minutes. If her router supports both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz Wi-Fi, then you'll need to do this process twice to connect both bands.
 
The other option, of course, is to ask your landlady for the password. If she didn't change the default settings on her router, then the Wi-Fi password(s) will be printed on a label attached to the router. Again, if the router is dual-band (i.e. 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz), there will be two SSID's and two passwords. Then follow the instructions (page 15, 22 or 33) in the manual to enter the password into the extender.
 
I have the new router name and password...I just don't know how to provide this new information to my extender. I have successfully connected my computers which are connected via cable. I need to get the new info to the extender so I can connect my printer, ipad, and phone.
 
The web links to www.mywifiext.net and www.mywifiext.net take me to error pages. Apparently what I need is to somehow log into Maintenance ->set password, but the web page it says to go to does not work.
 
I keep trying all the things in the instruction manual, and that I can find online, I even reset the device to factory settings, and I keep getting "connection refused" or error messages when I try to find some way to get into Maintenance. The extender sees the router, but I can't get into the extender to tell it the new router name and new password.
 
I am watching the video and same with all the things I've done ... it SHOULD launch the wizard but does not. And I could not figure out how to launch that Genie page manually. I would enter the web adderess, and, as mentioned, get an error page. \*\*\* My whole problem has been I could not launch Netgear Genie!!! \*\*\*
 
A couple of weeks into the new release, and after I installed the Rockton Toolbox for GP that was just release last week which still requires you to claim the new registration keys from the support, I noticed myself that I need to dig into the issue with login & password not retained anymore.
 
1. update a value in the DYNAMICS..SY01402 table to retain the status
2. Alter the flag in the DEX.ini file to make the option available at login time (remember, before you logged in, no DB access ! )
 
Now this is were the problem happens.. In my GP2013R2, this works as expected.. meaning that if the option has never been used before, checking the box in GP sets the value AND adds the following entry in the DEX.ini file :
 
It is a good idea to change your passwords often for security purposes. Your Account Management Panel (AMP) password is no exception. It is a very important password as it allows access to your hosting account as well as contact and billing information. Follow the instructions below to change your AMP password from within your AMP itself.
 
Sorry for the problem with the password. If none of the existing password recovery methods are working, then please contact our live technical support team. They will be able to assist you in recovery or resetting your Account Management Panel (AMP) password.
 
But, I want insert link "Change password" and "Forget Password" under password in login slice. I am grateful if any expert guide me to achieve this. I tried various methods but unable to achieve desired link s placement.
 
Vultera's A-to-Z booklet helps you store personal information about all the addresses, passwords, email & WiFi data that comes your way every day. This gives you peace of mind and saves time while entering your login details. This way you no longer have to create a new password every time, but simply take the booklet. The same applies to addresses for sending letters to friends and family, for example.

 The A-to-Z booklet is therefore a combination of an address book and password book. All in alphabetical order
